# Changelog

All notable changes to TurboVault will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.7] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- **Upgraded TurboMCP to v3.0.0**: Full migration to TurboMCP v3 with `TelemetryConfig`-based observability, `#[turbomcp::server]` macro, and `McpHandlerExt` transport abstraction
- **Standardized response serialization**: All tools now use `StandardResponse::to_json()` consistently instead of mixed serialization patterns
- **Removed stale workspace dependencies**: Dropped unused `opentelemetry`, `tracing-opentelemetry`, and `opentelemetry-otlp` workspace deps (v0.28) that were superseded by turbomcp-telemetry (v0.31)

### Added

- **Cross-platform prebuilt binaries**: Release workflow now builds binaries for 7 targets (Linux glibc/musl x86_64/ARM64, macOS x86_64/ARM64, Windows x86_64) with macOS code signing/notarization, SHA256 checksums, and GitHub Releases
- **CI workflow modernized**: Bumped to `actions/checkout@v5`, stable Rust toolchain, `CARGO_TERM_COLOR`

### Fixed

- **Stale cache on external file modifications**: `read_note` now validates cache entries against the file's modification time on disk, so externally modified files (git sync, direct writes, other processes) are always read fresh instead of serving stale/empty cached content (fixes #5)
- **Server version mismatch**: MCP server macro now correctly advertises the current crate version to clients (was hardcoded to 1.1.6)
- **Repository metadata on crates.io**: All 8 workspace crates now set `repository.workspace = true`, so every crate on crates.io links back to the GitHub repo (fixes #4)
- **Removed unused variable** in `explain_vault` tool

### Improved

- **`get_hub_notes` now accepts `top_n` parameter**: Previously hardcoded to 10, now configurable with `top_n: Option<usize>` (default 10)

## [1.2.6] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Line offset tracking for inline elements**: `Link` and `Image` variants in `InlineElement` now include optional `line_offset` field that tracks the relative line position within nested list items. This enables precise positioning of inline elements for consumers that need line-level granularity.
- **Comprehensive nested inline element collection**: New `collect_inline_elements()` function recursively traverses nested blocks (paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, details) to gather all inline elements and populate parent list items' inline field. This ensures links and images from all nesting levels are discoverable.
- **Enhanced list parsing for nested items**: Improved handling of nested list structures with proper line offset tracking, indentation preservation, and task checkbox support across all nesting depths.

### Changed

- **List item inline field now complete**: Parent list items' `inline` field now contains links and images from all nested children, enabling comprehensive inline element discovery without manual traversal.

## [1.2.5] - 2025-12-12

### Changed

- **Optimized frontmatter parsing**: Removed redundant regex-based frontmatter extraction in favor of pulldown-cmark's byte offset tracking, eliminating a duplicate parse pass
- **Deprecated `extract_frontmatter`**: Function marked deprecated in favor of `ParseEngine` with `frontmatter_end_offset` for better performance

## [1.2.4] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- **Plain text extraction**: New `to_plain_text()` API for extracting visible text from markdown content, stripping all syntax. Useful for:
  - Search indexing (index only searchable text)
  - Accurate match counts (fixes treemd search mismatch where `[Overview](#overview)` counted URL chars)
  - Word counts
  - Accessibility text extraction
- `InlineElement::to_plain_text(&self) -> &str` - Extract text from inline elements (links return link text, images return alt text)
- `ListItem::to_plain_text(&self) -> String` - Extract text from list items including nested blocks
- `ContentBlock::to_plain_text(&self) -> String` - Extract text from any content block recursively
- `to_plain_text(markdown: &str) -> String` - Standalone function to parse and extract plain text in one call
- Exported `to_plain_text` from `turbovault_parser` crate and prelude
- **Search result metrics**: `SearchResultInfo` now includes `word_count` and `char_count` fields for content size estimation
- **Export readability metrics**: `VaultStatsRecord` now includes `total_words`, `total_readable_chars`, and `avg_words_per_note`

### Changed

- **Search engine uses plain text**: Tantivy index now indexes plain text content instead of raw markdown, improving search relevance
- **Keyword extraction uses plain text**: `find_related()` now extracts keywords from visible text only, excluding URLs and markdown syntax
- **Search previews use plain text**: Search result previews and snippets now show human-readable text without markdown formatting

## [1.2.3] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- Updated turbomcp dependency to 2.3.3 for compatibility with latest MCP server framework

## [1.2.2] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- Dependency version bump to turbomcp 2.3.2

### Changed

- Updated all workspace dependencies to latest compatible versions

### Fixed

- Optimized binary search in excluded ranges for improved performance
- Removed unused dependencies to reduce binary size

## [1.2.0] - 2024-12-08

### Added

- **`Anchor` LinkType variant**: Distinguishes same-document anchors (`#section`) from cross-file heading references (`file.md#section`). This is a breaking change for exhaustive match statements on `LinkType`.
- **`BlockRef` detection**: Wikilinks with block references (`[[Note#^blockid]]`) now correctly return `LinkType::BlockRef` instead of `LinkType::HeadingRef`.
- **Block-level parsing**: New `parse_blocks()` function for full markdown AST parsing, including:
  - `ContentBlock` enum: Heading, Paragraph, Code, List, Blockquote, Table, Image, HorizontalRule, Details
  - `InlineElement` enum: Text, Strong, Emphasis, Code, Link, Image, Strikethrough
  - `ListItem` struct with task checkbox support
  - `TableAlignment` enum for table column alignment
- **Shared link utilities**: New `parsers::link_utils` module with `classify_url()` and `classify_wikilink()` functions for consistent link type classification.
- **Re-exported core types from turbovault-parser**: `ContentBlock`, `InlineElement`, `LinkType`, `ListItem`, `TableAlignment`, `LineIndex`, `SourcePosition` are now directly accessible from `turbovault_parser`, eliminating the need for consumers to depend on `turbovault-core` separately.

### Changed

- **Heading anchor generation**: Now uses improved `slugify()` function that properly collapses consecutive hyphens and handles edge cases per Obsidian's behavior.
- **Consolidated duplicate code**: Removed duplicate `classify_url()` implementations from engine.rs and markdown_links.rs in favor of shared utility.

### Fixed

- **Code block awareness**: Patterns inside fenced code blocks, inline code, and HTML blocks are no longer incorrectly extracted as links/tags/embeds.
- **Image parsing in blocks**: Fixed bug where inline images inside paragraphs were causing empty blocks.
